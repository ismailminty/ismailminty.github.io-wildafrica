    <p>The cheetah (/ˈtʃiːtə/; Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae
     that occurs in Southern, North and East Africa, and a few localities in Iran. The species 
     is IUCN Red Listed as vulnerable, as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range 
     in the 20th century due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal pet trade, and conflict with humans. By
      2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in 
      the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures
